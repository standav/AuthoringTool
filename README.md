# What is GLORIA?
GLORIA stands for “GLObal Robotic-telescopes Intelligent Array” (http://gloria-project.eu). GLORIA will be the first free and open- access network of robotic telescopes in the world. 
It will be a Web 2.0 environment where users can do research in astronomy by observing with robotic telescopes, and/or by analysing data that other users have acquired with GLORIA, or from other free access databases, 
like the European Virtual Observatory (http://www.euro-vo.org)..
